Hello! Welcome to my AWS Auto Scaling project demonstration.

Today I'll be showcasing how to deploy a scalable web application using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Groups and automated configuration scripts.

This project demonstrates a fundamental cloud computing concept: horizontal scaling. Instead of making one server bigger when demand increases, we automatically add more servers to handle the load.

Here's how it works:

First, I created a Launch Template that defines how new EC2 instances should be configured. This template includes the Amazon Linux 2 operating system and a User Data script.

The User Data script is the key automation component. When each new instance launches, this Bash script automatically installs the Apache web server, configures it to start on boot, and creates a simple HTML page that displays the server's hostname and metadata.

Next, I set up an Auto Scaling Group that uses this Launch Template. The Auto Scaling Group monitors the health of our instances and automatically replaces any that fail. It can also scale the number of instances up or down based on demand.

The beauty of this setup is its self-healing nature. If an instance fails, the Auto Scaling Group automatically launches a replacement. If traffic increases, we can configure it to add more instances. If traffic decreases, it can terminate unnecessary instances to save costs.

This architecture follows AWS best practices for building resilient, scalable applications. It demonstrates infrastructure as code principles, where our entire setup can be reproduced consistently through configuration rather than manual steps.

The project showcases several important cloud concepts: automation, scalability, high availability, and cost optimization. These are fundamental skills for any cloud engineer working with AWS.

This type of architecture forms the foundation for many real-world applications, from simple websites to complex microservices platforms.

Thank you for watching this demonstration of AWS Auto Scaling in action!
