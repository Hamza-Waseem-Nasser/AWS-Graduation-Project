# Architecture Overview

## Solution Architecture

This project implements a scalable web application architecture using AWS services. The solution demonstrates horizontal scaling, high availability, and automated infrastructure management.

## Components

### Core Services
- **Amazon EC2**: Virtual servers hosting the web application
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Manages instance lifecycle and scaling
- **Launch Template**: Defines instance configuration
- **Security Groups**: Network-level firewall rules
- **Amazon VPC**: Virtual private cloud networking

### Optional Enhancements
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across instances
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
- **Route 53**: DNS management
- **S3**: Static content storage

## Architecture Flow

1. **User Request**: Client sends HTTP request
2. **Load Balancer**: (Optional) Distributes request to healthy instance
3. **EC2 Instance**: Processes request using Apache web server
4. **Auto Scaling**: Monitors health and adjusts capacity
5. **Response**: HTML page with instance information returned

## Scaling Behavior

### Scale Out Events
- CPU utilization > 70% for 2 consecutive periods
- Custom CloudWatch alarms triggered
- Manual capacity increase

### Scale In Events
- CPU utilization < 30% for 5 consecutive periods
- Manual capacity decrease
- Scheduled scaling policies

## High Availability

- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Instances spread across availability zones
- **Health Checks**: Automatic replacement of unhealthy instances
- **Load Distribution**: Even traffic distribution across instances
- **Fault Tolerance**: Service continues if individual instances fail

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- Security groups restrict inbound traffic to HTTP (port 80)
- Private subnets for database tier (if implemented)
- NAT Gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets

### Access Control
- IAM roles for EC2 instances
- Principle of least privilege
- No hardcoded credentials in user data

### Data Protection
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS recommended)
- Encryption at rest for EBS volumes
- Regular security patching via Systems Manager

## Cost Optimization

### Right-Sizing
- t2.micro instances for development/testing
- t3.medium or larger for production workloads
- Monitoring CPU and memory utilization

### Scaling Efficiency
- Aggressive scale-in policies to minimize idle instances
- Scheduled scaling for predictable workloads
- Spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads

### Resource Management
- Automatic termination of unhealthy instances
- Resource tagging for cost allocation
- Reserved instances for baseline capacity

## Monitoring and Observability

### CloudWatch Metrics
- CPU Utilization
- Network In/Out
- HTTP request count (with ALB)
- Instance health status

### Logging
- Apache access logs
- System logs via CloudWatch Logs
- Application-specific logging

### Alarms
- High CPU utilization
- Instance failures
- Network anomalies

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- AMI snapshots of configured instances
- EBS snapshot automation
- Configuration backup via AWS Config

### Recovery Procedures
- Multi-AZ deployment provides automatic failover
- Launch template enables quick environment recreation
- Auto Scaling ensures service continuity

## Performance Considerations

### Instance Performance
- Appropriate instance types for workload
- EBS-optimized instances for I/O intensive applications
- Placement groups for low-latency requirements

### Application Performance
- Keep-alive connections for HTTP
- Caching strategies (ElastiCache integration)
- CDN integration (CloudFront)

## Compliance and Governance

### Tagging Strategy
- Environment (dev, test, prod)
- Owner/Team
- Project/Application
- Cost Center

### Configuration Management
- Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation/Terraform)
- Version control for launch templates
- Change management processes

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Scaling
- Predictive scaling using machine learning
- Custom scaling metrics
- Target tracking scaling policies

### Microservices Evolution
- Container-based deployment (ECS/EKS)
- Service mesh implementation
- API Gateway integration

### Advanced Monitoring
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Distributed tracing
- Custom business metrics

### Security Hardening
- WAF integration
- DDoS protection
- Certificate management automation
